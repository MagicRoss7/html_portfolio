<h1>Ross's Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Picks</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>
This movie was extremely groundbreaking in terms of how incredibly realistic the dinosaurs were. Till today the special effects of this movie are second to none.
</p>
<h3>White Chicks</h3>
<p>
This movie is one of the funniest movies of all time. Filled to the brim with cheeky racial humour and even though I've watched it countless times it still makes me laugh.
</p>
<h3>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
<p>This is my favourite of all the Harry Potter movies because there was a lot more magic to enjoy and the movie itself took on a more serious tone. You also get to see my favourite spell "Expecto Patronum" being used.</p>
